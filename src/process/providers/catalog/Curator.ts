/**
 * Curator - the pure curation function of the two-tier model store.
 *
 * The assembler produces a full `CatalogModel[]` (every model every source
 * exposes). The Curator derives the much smaller `CuratedModel[]` view the chat
 * model picker shows: the latest model in each family, plus the one revision
 * before it.
 *
 * ## Rules
 *
 * 1. Only `kind === 'text'` models are curated. Image / audio / embedding models
 *    stay in the full catalog for other features but never reach the picker.
 * 2. Text models are grouped by `family`.
 * 3. Within a family, models are ordered newest-first by `releaseDate`. A model
 *    with no `releaseDate` sorts last.
 * 4. **A family is eligible for the recommended set only when at least one of
 *    its models is `enriched: true`.** models.dev enrichment is the local
 *    quality signal that a family is current/relevant - providers like OpenAI
 *    expose legacy ids on `/v1/models` (Babbage, Davinci, dated GPT-3.5
 *    Turbos, internal Computer-Use previews, …) that models.dev correctly
 *    declines to track. Without this filter every unmatched id becomes a
 *    singleton "family" and every legacy model gets flagged Recommended, which
 *    defeats the entire two-tier curation premise. Unenriched models still
 *    flow through to the catalog (visible in "More in the catalog") - they
 *    just don't get the `recommended: true` badge.
 * 5. **Known-legacy ids never recommend.** Even when models.dev still tracks a
 *    deprecated id (e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo`), the Curator excludes it from the
 *    recommended set via `KNOWN_LEGACY_IDS`. See the constant for the per-id
 *    rationale. The model still appears in the full catalog ("More in the
 *    catalog") - users can opt in - it just never gets the flagship badge.
 * 6. **Recency floor.** A family's flagship qualifies for recommendation only
 *    when its `releaseDate` is within the last `RECENCY_WINDOW_DAYS`. Older
 *    flagships still surface in "More in the catalog" - they're pickable, just
 *    not flagged Recommended. Reference date is the latest `releaseDate` in
 *    the catalog (keeps the curator pure - no `Date.now()`).
 * 7. **Display-name dedup.** Two models in the same family sharing the same
 *    `displayName` collapse to one: the one with a `releaseDate` wins, else
 *    the one with the longer id (which is usually the dated variant). Catches
 *    models.dev shipping both an alias (`computer-use-preview`) and the
 *    dated variant (`computer-use-preview-2025-03-11`) with the same name.
 * 8. Within an eligible family, the newest model → `recommended: true,
 *    enabled: true, role: 'flagship'`. The second-newest → `recommended: true,
 *    enabled: true, role: 'previous'`. A single-model family yields only a
 *    flagship.
 * 9. Every other model - including every model in an ineligible family, every
 *    KNOWN_LEGACY_IDS id, and any flagship outside the recency window - gets
 *    `recommended: false, enabled: false`, no `role`.
 *
 * Fast/cheap families (Haiku, GPT mini, Gemini Flash) are NOT special-cased -
 * they form their own families and are surfaced by exactly the same rule. Cost
 * is deliberately not an input to curation. The `role: 'fast'` value exists in
 * the type for future use but this curator never emits it.
 *
 * This function is genuinely PURE: no network, no filesystem, no `Date.now()`.
 * Given the same input it always returns a deeply equal result, and it never
 * mutates its input.
