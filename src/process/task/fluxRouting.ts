/**
 * Per-backend ENV that, injected at spawn, makes a generic ACP backend route
 * through Flux WITHOUT writing any CLI config file (R13-safe). Every entry gets
 * the shared OPENAI_* surface (added in `resolveFluxRouting`); the value here is
 * the EXTRA, backend-specific env that selects the openai-compatible provider +
 * the flux-auto model for that particular CLI.
 *
 * Membership = empirically verified against a local OpenAI-compatible capture
 * server (2026-06-05), each confirmed to send `flux-auto` and return an answer:
 *
 *  - qwen: the shared OPENAI_BASE_URL + OPENAI_MODEL=flux-auto is enough; it
 *    posts to `/v1/chat/completions`. (No extra env.)
 *  - goose: also needs GOOSE_PROVIDER=openai + GOOSE_MODEL=flux-auto, otherwise
 *    it bails with "No provider configured" and never reads OPENAI_BASE_URL.
 *
 * Shared caveat: a CLI whose own config already pins an openai baseUrl/provider
 * may let the config win over these env vars (verified for an existing
 * `~/.qwen/settings.json`). That is additive/safe - the backend runs natively,
 * never stranded or rewritten - so the common clean-config user still gets Flux.
 *
 * NOT here, by design:
 *  - opencode / qoder: openai-capable but cannot be pointed at Flux env-only
 *    (opencode defaults to a non-openai provider + rejects flux-auto from its
 *    catalog; qoder routes through its own login). They need the config-writing
 *    setup assistant (backup -> write flux provider -> report -> rollback).
 *  - droid / auggie / copilot / kiro / vibe: vendor-locked to their own service
 *    (Factory / Augment / GitHub / AWS / Mistral); not Flux-routable. They stay
 *    native and the routing badge says so.
 *  - codex / codebuddy: openai/responses-surface npx backends, routing handled
 *    separately (codex uses the responses surface; not in this set).
 *
 * claude is NOT here either: it routes via the Anthropic surface, tracked in the
 * separate `ANTHROPIC_FLUX_BACKENDS` set below.
