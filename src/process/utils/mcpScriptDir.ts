 * Resolve the directory containing the bundled MCP stdio scripts.
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 * Four stdio scripts are spawned as external `node` child processes:
 *   - team-mcp-stdio.js          (team coordination tools)
 *   - team-guide-mcp-stdio.js    (solo aion_* tools)
 *   - builtin-mcp-image-gen.js   (image generation)
 *   - builtin-mcp-search-skills.js (skills library)
 *
 * `scripts/build-mcp-servers.js` emits them next to the main bundle:
 *   - dev:      <project>/app/out/main/
 *   - packaged: <resources>/app.asar.unpacked/out/main/
 *
 * Reliable resolution
 * -------------------
 * The previous resolvers (`resolveMcpScriptDir` in tcpHelpers.ts and
 * `getBuiltinMcpBaseDir` in initStorage.ts) trusted runtime hints that proved
 * unreliable in dev:
 *   - `app.getAppPath()` returned `.../app/out/main` in dev with electron-vite,
 *     so `path.join(appPath, 'out', 'main')` produced a doubled path
 *     `.../app/out/main/out/main/` that didn't exist. Every `team_*` tool
 *     silently failed to register because the stdio child died with
 *     MODULE_NOT_FOUND.
 *   - `require.main?.filename` can be a launcher script, not the main bundle,
 *     so its dirname is not the bundle dir.
 *
 * The one hint that is *guaranteed* correct after bundling is `__dirname` of
 * the bundle file. esbuild/electron-vite preserve it literally so the value at
 * runtime is the directory the file is loaded from - i.e. `out/main/` for
 * `index.js`, or `out/main/chunks/` for code-split chunks. This module is
 * itself bundled into `out/main/index.js` so its `__dirname` is the answer we
 * want (with the chunks carve-out).
 *
 * Packaged mode
 * -------------
 * In packaged builds the bundle is loaded from inside `app.asar`. External
 * `node` processes cannot read from ASAR, so we redirect the dir to
 * `app.asar.unpacked` (which `electron-builder` configures via `asarUnpack`).
